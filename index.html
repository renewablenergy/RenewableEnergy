<p>The conversation in our capital markets is changing rapidly. Investors are expressing their values through investment decisions, while companies are feeling the need to serve a wider range of stakeholders. Both are emphasizing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors in how they measure success, making it critical that investors and issuers alike are fluent in the language of ESG.</p>

<p>This language, however, is not chiseled in stone and handed to companies and investors. It evolves every day. Much as the key financial concepts that we all agree on today — revenue, net income and assets — developed established definitions only after decades of discussion by market participants, the syntax of ESG is expanding constantly, including topics like climate impact, transition risk and diversity. </p>

<p>At this stage of the ESG evolution, the NYSE community plays an important role in advancing the dialogue as each company identifies the ESG issues that are the most important to its business, integrates its approach to these issues into the business strategy, and then delivers this narrative to investors and other stakeholders. This approach will shape how your company, industry and the entire business community are viewed.</p>
<p>For most companies, focusing on serving a broad range of stakeholder and ESG issues is not new, but telling that story might be. To help address this need, the NYSE is releasing its ESG Guidance: Best Practices for Sustainability Reporting. The information below can help you speak the language of ESG in conversations with investors and other stakeholders, even if you have never before engaged in these discussions. As with all languages, dialects arise that are specific to certain regions and topics. Some of the most important topics will be specific to your industry and the issues that it faces — for example, biodiversity and access to medicine in the healthcare space. Others will be more universal -- for example, diversity and climate change affect every industry.  </p>

<p>These best practices represents a voluntary set of guidelines for companies; these are not listing standards, regulations or requirements. They are intended to help you make further progress, or even get started, on your ESG journey.</p>

<p>Over the coming months, you will continue to hear more from the NYSE team on all things ESG. Our goal is to help lower the barriers to ESG engagement with your investors, give you the tools to benchmark ESG disclosures, and connect you to ESG experts who can help at any stage in the development of your approach to ESG. We stand ready to help you tell your story, delivering the narrative that presents your company as both an investment and an organization that is living its purpose for employees, communities and greater society.   </p>

Some companies conduct a formal assessment of these issues, either by external discussions with shareholders and other stakeholders, or internally by looking at ESG issues already on the board’s agenda or included in the company’s business plan or risk management program. Companies should be able to answer the question: how do the specific ESG issues that the company has chosen to focus on contribute to its short-term financial performance and/or long-term value creation? </p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p></div><div class="py-8 px-4 md:px-16 bg-black text-white"><div class="text-white"><p data-type="lead" class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0 text-lg font-bold leading-6">Deforestation – a practical example:</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">In November 2020, the United Kingdom proposed new legislation banning the sale of commodities grown on land that had been illegally cleared.<a href="#footnotes" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span><span class="text-[smaller]" style="color:#8dc7e9;vertical-align:super">8</span></span></a>  Under the law, affected companies would incur the costs associated with compliance including (potentially) the need to restructure supply chains.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Importantly, concerns about deforestation are not new.

Companies that produce or purchase commodities (such as soy, beef, cocoa, palm oil) and are typically associated with deforestation may face regulatory changes, pressure from investors or other stakeholders. After evaluating these increased risks, some companies have introduced their own measures to enhance product traceability. Some may even have gone as far as to invest (where possible) in certification of commodities to provide greater assurance that these are not associated with unsustainable agricultural practices. These companies that are effectively managing deforestation risks will arguably have a competitive advantage over those that may be simply reacting to legislative changes - in this case, a link from an ESG lens to strategy can produce a directly measurable benefit.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"><a href="/" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span></span></a>Find out more: <a href="https://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/investor-guide-deforestation-and-climate-change?gclid=CjwKCAiAtK79BRAIEiwA4OskBrSGD7xyG5vGC80j7THr5vJb06sZbWVrl6LnXQ_XShRefxjFnSQzChoCd4gQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span><span class="" style="color:#8dc7e9">Ceres Investor Guide to Deforestation and Climate Change </span></span></a></p></div></div><div class="h-10"></div><div class=""><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p><div class="mb-6"></div><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Companies new to ESG reporting may wish to begin by examining what issues their peers are focused on - reviewing reporting and disclosures from both peers as well as companies upstream and downstream in the supply chain.

Whether your company is engaged in an active ESG program or not, reviewing your existing disclosures in the context of how peers communicate, including messaging in SEC filings and your proxy statement, is a worthwhile exercise. With each company’s reporting, watch for a) which issues the company is focused on, and b) how and why each company believes these are relevant. Many companies are doing great things with respect to their ESG strategy but do not get full credit for their efforts because they do not clearly or effectively communicate what they are doing in a manner digestible by stakeholders.  A good reporting strategy will help ensure that your stakeholders acknowledge your company’s ESG efforts.</p></div></article></section></section><div class="h-1"></div><section id="identifying-your-stakeholders" class="flex flex-row border-0 border-solid border-black py-8 first:mt-3 last:mb-3 border-t-2 border-b-2"><section class="ml-2 cursor-pointer"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="h-6 w-6" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19 13h-6v6h-2v-6H5v-2h6V5h2v6h6v2z"></path></svg></section><section class="ml-4 w-full flex-col"><header class=" cursor-pointer"><h2 class="my-0">Identifying stakeholders and evaluating the state of engagement</h2></header><article data-testid="collapsible-section-body" class="h-0 overflow-hidden origin-top transition-all duration-200 ease-out max-h-0 scale-y-0 opacity-0"><div style="clear:both;float:right;max-width:32%" class="ml-4 mb-4"><div class="tile tile-topbar"><div class="tile-content"><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"><a href="https://www.nyse.com/esg/issuer-insights/brian-matt" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span>Interview</span></a> + <a href="https://www.theice.com/insights/conversations/inside-the-ice-house/a-clear-eyed-view-on-esg-from-ihs-markit-brian-matt" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span>Podcast</span></a> with Brian Matt on what investors really want</p></div></div></div><div class=""><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">There is a growing consensus that a company’s ability to generate shareholder returns over the long run is at least in part dependent on its relationships with key stakeholder groups -- e.g. customers, employees, suppliers and the communities in which you operate. More broadly, it also suggests a way of thinking about how those returns are generated – delivering value to customers, with due regard for the environment; fostering an inclusive and motivated workforce, dignity and respect in the workplace, fair and ethical treatment of suppliers, and support for and from the communities in which the company operates. </p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Identifying your key stakeholders: Deciding who your company’s stakeholders are is an important step in developing and implementing an ESG strategy. Some of your stakeholders will be obvious – such as investors, employees and customers. Others can be more challenging to identify. One commonly-used framework, the GRI Standards (see section 7 for further details), provide some guidance in this regard, suggesting: “Stakeholders are … entities or individuals that can reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by the reporting organization’s activities, products, or services; or whose actions can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of the organization to implement its strategies or achieve its objectives”.<a href="#footnotes" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span><span class="text-[smaller]" style="vertical-align:super">10</span> </span></a> </p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Other stakeholders companies may consider:</p><div data-rich-text-ignore="true"><ul class="inline-block pr-0 text-left pl-8 space-y-4 [&amp;_ol]:mt-4 [&amp;_ul]:mt-4 list-disc list-outside"><li>Employees</li><li>Suppliers (direct and further up the supply chain)</li><li>Regulators, particularly of the industry that your company operates in</li><li>Civil society organizations</li><li>Communities in which your company operates </li></ul></div><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">These lists are not exhaustive, and each company should apply its unique perspective to determine who its most relevant stakeholders are.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Measuring current engagement: Once your stakeholders have been identified, the next step is to ensure the company has mechanisms in place for stakeholder engagement. One primary purpose of stakeholder engagement is to identify how stakeholders think about the company and its conduct as it relates to their interests. In addition, this engagement can help the company identify key ESG issues that are likely to impact your company’s performance directly or indirectly and to appropriately manage stakeholder expectations and concerns. </p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Your company may already conduct some level of proactive stakeholder engagement, which can help your company identify new opportunities and enable more effective risk management. It can also build trust. It may not be possible to keep all stakeholders happy all of the time, but if stakeholders feel their perspectives are considered and that they have avenues to raise concerns, then it may make trade-offs more palatable. </p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Tools for stakeholder engagement include:</p><div data-rich-text-ignore="true"><ul class="inline-block pr-0 text-left pl-8 space-y-4 [&amp;_ol]:mt-4 [&amp;_ul]:mt-4 list-disc list-outside"><li>Regular investor outreach</li><li>Surveys</li><li>Interviews</li><li>Media (including social media) monitoring</li><li>Focus-group discussions</li><li>Townhalls</li></ul></div><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">The concepts of stakeholder identification and engagement are not new. For example, many companies, having identified employees and customers as key stakeholders, already do employee and/or customer satisfaction surveys. Applying an ESG lens to this inquiry may simply expand the scope of stakeholders that are considered and the nature of the conversations that are held.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Stakeholders and ESG reporting: Identifying the company’s key stakeholders allows the company to make informed decisions about what to report and where to report it, allowing you to present information in a way that is most relevant to each audience. Second, some users of ESG reporting are interested in understanding who your company thinks its key stakeholders are and how you are managing those stakeholder relationships. Finally, displaying how the company performs with respect to metrics relevant to these stakeholders can help build trust.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">As the company progresses in the ESG process, it will likely seek to revisit its stakeholder engagement program periodically as it seeks to both communicate its approach to issues as well as listen for new emerging issues.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p></div></article></section></section><div class="h-1"></div><section id="assessing-materiality" class="flex flex-row border-0 border-solid border-black py-8 first:mt-3 last:mb-3 border-t-2 border-b-2"><section class="ml-2 cursor-pointer"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="h-6 w-6" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19 13h-6v6h-2v-6H5v-2h6V5h2v6h6v2z"></path></svg></section><section class="ml-4 w-full flex-col"><header class=" cursor-pointer"><h2 class="my-0">Assessing materiality</h2></header><article data-testid="collapsible-section-body" class="h-0 overflow-hidden origin-top transition-all duration-200 ease-out max-h-0 scale-y-0 opacity-0"><div class=""><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">The concept of materiality is often used in an SEC reporting context to identify what information companies should disclose, and traditional definitions of materiality tend to focus on investors as the primary users of reported information. However, a similar concept of materiality might reasonably be applied to determining which ESG issues should be presented to a broader set of relevant stakeholders. In essence, materiality is a lens or filter that allows your company to determine the ESG issues on which your stakeholders focus. Of note, the Corporate Reporting Dialogue (CRD) suggests that ”(m)aterial information is that, which is reasonably capable of making a difference to the proper evaluation of the issue at hand.”<a href="#footnotes" class="inline-flex items-center no-underline hover:underline cursor-pointer print:text-black print:underline text-secondary hover:text-secondary font-bold"><span><span class="text-[smaller]" style="vertical-align:super">11</span></span></a>  This perspective encompasses a range of stakeholders and is aligned with the idea of broad stakeholder accountability.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">It is therefore important to decide how you define materiality for your purposes when reviewing the issues that are relevant for your ESG program. Some definitions focus solely on issues that are deemed to be financially material i.e. to focus on the ESG issues that impact your financial performance. Others also consider the impacts that your company has on society and the environment. Some use the term “double materiality” to describe the idea that companies consider both the ESG issues that impact your company as well as your company’s impact on society/the environment. Still others suggest this distinction is a moot argument as company value creation can only be understood in the context of its operating environment and the impacts it has.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Regardless of whether your company is focused solely on financial risk and opportunity or impact more broadly, the other key input to your materiality determination is the perspective of key stakeholders.

In adopting a more focused approach, your company can demonstrate that it has a strong handle on the ESG issues and is committed to managing them effectively. A concise, well-thought thorough description can be as compelling as, if not more so than, a lengthy publication with extensive disclosures across a range of topics. While this awareness is relevant for all companies, it should be particularly reassuring for smaller companies or companies who are new to ESG and ESG reporting.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Your company may also want to think about where and how you communicate relevant ESG information, depending on the audience. If your company chooses to provide focused disclosure for different stakeholder groups, be careful to ensure consistency across your disclosures (e.g. differences in diversity rates can be attributed to a metric that is regulatorily defined in a particular jurisdiction in one way, while the company, for its own purposes, uses another that it believes is more relevant).</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"><span class="font-bold">Ongoing stakeholder engagement </span></p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Companies should look to formally refresh the materiality process and the message for two-way stakeholder engagement as their stories evolve. Keep in mind your stakeholders may face their own changing demands for information. As one example, as of 2021, European asset managers face new regulations with respect to reporting on the ESG characteristics of their portfolio companies. These “second-order” effects may flow downstream to the issuers of securities in these portfolios, who may face disclosure demands in line with these regulations. For each stakeholder group, listening for the changes in the issues and topics mentioned, as well as sharing feedback formally within the company, should become a standard process.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p></div></article></section></section><div class="h-1"></div><section id="reporting-frameworks-and-standards" class="flex flex-row border-0 border-solid border-black py-8 first:mt-3 last:mb-3 border-t-2 border-b-2"><section class="ml-2 cursor-pointer"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="h-6 w-6" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19 13h-6v6h-2v-6H5v-2h6V5h2v6h6v2z"></path></svg></section><section class="ml-4 w-full flex-col"><header class=" cursor-pointer"><h2 class="my-0">Reporting frameworks and standards</h2></header><article data-testid="collapsible-section-body" class="h-0 overflow-hidden origin-top transition-all duration-200 ease-out max-h-0 scale-y-0 opacity-0"><div class="grid gap-y-4 md:grid-cols-12 md:gap-x-4"><div style="overflow-x:auto;grid-column:span 8"><div class=""><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">High-quality reporting relies on the disclosure of accurate, balanced and comparable information that provides genuine insights.

Stakeholders would rather see that a company understands what the core issues are and is taking steps to address them, than be presented with an overly optimistic picture.</li><li><span class="font-bold">Comparable:</span> Information presented should be comparable (or consistent) from one reporting period to the next. The users of your ESG reporting are likely not just interested in your company’s performance at a point in time but also in how the company performs over time. This objective is much more challenging if the methods for how the information is collected, calculated, and presented, changes. In cases where it is necessary to make changes to reported information, these changes should be disclosed, as changes to the presentation of financial information is disclosed. Globally-recognized standards and frameworks, such as those provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Standards Accounting Board (SASB) (discussed in more detail below), may provide guidance for companies to consider for many core ESG disclosure topics. <br/><br/>The notion of comparability is sometimes also used to refer to the ability to compare ESG performance across companies in the same sector or industry. Companies may wish to review the types of metrics on which their peers report or refer to sector-specific standards such as the SASB Standards or those created by industry-specific bodies. Ultimately, the company should make its own determination of which metrics to consider (as referenced in Section 3, above).</li><li><span class="font-bold">Contextualized:</span> Most ESG data does not exist in a vacuum but needs to be properly contextualized to be understood. Some of this context may come from relative performance of the company (with reference to other companies in the sector or to historic performance). Context can also derive from a company’s operating locations and broader understanding of so-called sustainability thresholds and the local legal structure. For example, if you’re reporting water usage, it should be reported with reference to how water usage affects your business strategy, as well as to local water availability and sustainable water use practices.</li></ul></div><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"></p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0"><span class="font-bold">Navigating the disclosure landscape</span></p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">Many companies choose to align their sustainability reporting with one or more ESG frameworks.

This information is used by investors to inform their investment decision making (though many investors also conduct their own analysis). Some research firms collect information directly from companies, using surveys or questionnaires. Others rely on publicly-available information (though may still ask the company to verify the collected information) while still others use some combination of public information and questionnaires. Different firms use different methodologies (though there is some overlap among them), which makes it challenging from a resource and cost perspective to address all of these.

class=\"spacer-sm\"><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>The conversation in our capital markets is changing rapidly. Investors are expressing their values through investment decisions, while companies are feeling the need to serve a wider range of stakeholders. Both are emphasizing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors in how they measure success, making it critical that investors and issuers alike are fluent in the language of ESG.<\/p>\n\n<p>This language, however, is not chiseled in stone and handed to companies and investors. It evolves every day. Much as the key financial concepts that we all agree on today — revenue, net income and assets — developed established definitions only after decades of discussion by market participants, the syntax of ESG is expanding constantly, including topics like climate impact, transition risk and diversity. <\/p>\n\n<p>At this stage of the ESG evolution, the NYSE community plays an important role in advancing the dialogue as each company identifies the ESG issues that are the most important to its business, integrates its approach to these issues into the business strategy, and then delivers this narrative to investors and other stakeholders. This approach will shape how your company, industry and the entire business community are viewed.<\/p>\n<p>For most companies, focusing on serving a broad range of stakeholder and ESG issues is not new, but telling that story might be. To help address this need, the NYSE is releasing its ESG Guidance: Best Practices for Sustainability Reporting. The information below can help you speak the language of ESG in conversations with investors and other stakeholders, even if you have never before engaged in these discussions. As with all languages, dialects arise that are specific to certain regions and topics. Some of the most important topics will be specific to your industry and the issues that it faces — for example, biodiversity and access to medicine in the healthcare space. Others will be more universal -- for example, diversity and climate change affect every industry.  <\/p>\n\n<p>These best practices represents a voluntary set of guidelines for companies; these are not listing standards, regulations or requirements. They are intended to help you make further progress, or even get started, on your ESG journey.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over the coming months, you will continue to hear more from the NYSE team on all things ESG. Our goal is to help lower the barriers to ESG engagement with your investors, give you the tools to benchmark ESG disclosures, and connect you to ESG experts who can help at any stage in the development of your approach to ESG. We stand ready to help you tell your story, delivering the narrative that presents your company as both an investment and an organization that is living its purpose for employees, communities and greater society.   <\/p>\n<p><strong>Stacey Cunningham<\/strong><br/>NYSE President<\/p> \n\n\n<style>\n.rounded {\n border-radius: 50%;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t"}}]},"bgGradientAngle":180,"visibility":{"mobile":true,"tablet":true,"desktop":true,"wideDesktop":true,"print":true,"screen":true},"preset":"Landing Section (highlight)","fullWidth":true}},{"id":"7276d66c-a8ce-4a32-9388-47828fe44b6a","name":"cms-component-rich-text","props":{"slots":{},"richTextNodes":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"spacer","children":[{"text":""}],"size":"lg"}]}},{"id":"f0ce4733-f256-40a9-bba6-5624be6f38e0","name":"cms-component-stacked-section","props":{"slots":{"content":[{"id":"b7386ba6-645f-45d8-a5be-0eb8ebd769be","name":"cms-component-rich-text","props":{"slots":{},"richTextNodes":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Corporations and their stakeholders are increasingly focusing on ESG and sustainability issues, including how companies manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities, and how those actions contribute to their ability to generate returns over the long term, retain and attract employees and customers, and thrive in their communities."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"One sign of the heightened focus on ESG issues is the growth in support for the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).
